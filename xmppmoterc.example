# vim: filetype=config 

[general]
# In this section, the type of command handler to be used is defined, using the
# handler option. The available handler types are restricted and passthru. The
# restricted handler only allows commands defined in the [commands] section to
# be executed, and the passthru handler just accepts anything you type, throwing
# it at subprocess.Popen and hoping that it sticks.
handler: restricted

[commands]
# In this section we defined the commands allowed by the restricted section. The
# syntax is "<key>:<command>:[args]:[help]", where <key> is a non-optional,
# arbitary key (should be unique, but its value does not matter), <command> is a
# the actual command to execute, [args] are any (optional) arguments to pass to
# the command, [help] is an optional help string to display upon issuing the
# help command. See the commands defined below for examples.
command1: uptime::List system uptime
command2: df:-h:Show disk usage
command3: pwd::

# NOTE: Remember to define this one if you want to be able to terminate the
#   XMPPMote process via chat.
command4: bye::Terminate XMPPMote
