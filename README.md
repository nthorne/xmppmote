xmppmote
========

Daemon for remote server administration over XMPP (e.g. control a headless server via Google Chat
on your smart phone).

dependencies
------------

XMPPMote depends on the excellent xmpppy library (http://xmpppy.sourceforge.net/),
and since fancy XMPPMote installers are on the backlog, so you will need to install
that one separately, e.g.

`$ sudo apt-get install python-pyxmpp`

usage
-----

First off, you will need to create a XMPP user (__use a unique password since the password
currently is stored in plain text__) on e.g. the Jabber network (http://www.jabber.org/create-an-account/),
and then initialise a chat session between that user, and the user that you wish to control
your box with; and since that session initialisation is not yet implemented in XMPPMote,
just go ahead and use a web based jabber client such as JWChat (http://jwchat.org/).

After having set up the XMPP user, copy xmppmoterc.example into xmppmoterc, and modify it to
suit your likings (i.e. command handler type, and possibly a set of allowed commands).
After configurating XMPPMote, the daemon is started by typing

`$ ./xmppmoted.py start`

which should cause you to be prompted for the username (including e.g. @jabber.org), and password
that you created for XMPPMote. After having entered the credentials, the bot should be online
in your chat client, and you can chat away with it until your heart is content; at which point
you can type **bye** into your client to terminate the bot.

For more command line options, type

`$ ./xmppmoted.py -h`

In order to have the daemon starting at system startup on an Ubuntu system, assuming that XMPPMote
is installed in /opt/xmppmote (otherwise, you'll need to update the xmppmote script that you copy
to /etc/default, according to its comments, copy initd-xmppmote and config-xmppmote to
/etc/init.d and run update-rc.d, e.g.

    $ sudo su
    # cp /opt/xmppmote/rc/initd-xmppmote /etc/init.d/xmppmote
    # cp /opt/xmppmote/rc/config-xmppmote /etc/default/xmppmote
    # update-rc.d xmppmote defaults

On any other system that supports System V style init scripts, it should work just fine, by
copying the init script and its configuration file as in the previous example (modifying th
configuration script if needed), and then simply symlinking the init script to the
appropriate runlevel, e.g.

    # cp /opt/xmppmote/rc/initd-xmppmote /etc/init.d/xmppmote
    # cp /opt/xmppmote/rc/config-xmppmote /etc/default/xmppmote
    # ln -s /etc/init.d/xmppmote /etc/rc3.d/S99xmppmote

final notes
-----------

This software is in early beta, so don't expect much regarding documentation and user friendliness.
